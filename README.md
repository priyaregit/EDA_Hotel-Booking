# EDA_Hotel-Booking-Analysis

The Hotel booking data set contains a host of information related to the bookings made in a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel that can be dissected and analyzed. Through an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the aim is to get useful insights about the trends in hotel booking, and also come up with information that can support business decisions and help generate additional revenue. Hence, this EDA carries special focus on two metrics: average daily rate (ADR) and booking cancellations.

There are 119,390 records and 32 features/columns in the data set, with information such as the type of hotel booked, customer type, duration of stay, average daily rate, reservation status and many other factors related to hotel booking.

Data Wrangling: Data was cleaned through appropriate handling of missing/null values and outliers. Data was also preprocessed through deletion of some unwanted columns and creation of some new ones. 

Data Visualization: The following plots from the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, were used for the purpose of data visualization: 
•	Bar Plot •	Line Plot •	Box Plot •	Violin Plot •	Scatter Plot •	Regression Plot •	Pie Chart •	Histogram •	Count Plot •	Correlation Heat Map

Data Analysis: The exploration of data was done in two steps. Through univariate analysis and basic data visualization, I was able to understand what information each individual feature was conveying. For example, what was the mean lead time of the bookings, what percentage of bookings had repeat guests, which hotel type received more special requests etc.

I then went on to perform multivariate analysis, wherein I have checked for relations between the different features. This section included an in-depth analysis of ADR and booking cancellations. The aim was to identify all the factors that influence them. For example, I have checked how the ADR has varied - during the different months of the year, according to market segments, for bookings done through different distribution channels, assigned room type etc. Similarly, I have checked for factors that may have a relation with booking cancellations such as lead time, days in waiting list, deposit type etc.

Insights from this EDA enables us to answer questions from both the customer's as well as the Hotels' perspective.

Some important questions from the customer’s perspective that can be answered are:

● When is the best time of the year to book the hotel rooms?

● Would room be assigned according to choice?

● What is the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate?

Questions from the Hotels’ perspective:

● When is the hotel more likely to receive high number of special requests?

● How can the ADR be increased?

● What are the reasons behind booking cancellations ?
